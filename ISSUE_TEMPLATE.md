<!--- In order to make the bug fixing process easier for both the reporter and whoever has to fix the bug, I have created some guidelines about how to write an issue on the github. -->

1. Briefly and accurately describe the issue and how to recreate it
2. Include a screenshot of the errant behavior
3. Paste the code that produces the unwanted behavior below the screenshot
4. Mark the issue as a bug and submit it

<!--- If the issue you are creating involves a suggestion about how to improve the highlighter, make sure you mark it with the Enhancement label.  Also, please remember to always be courteous to the Developers (Moesh and I) as we do not get paid for any of the work done here as it is done out of the goodness of our hearts. -->

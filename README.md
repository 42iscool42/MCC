## Using MCC Will Make Your Code Maintainable

__Latest news__

The v1.12 update of **Minecraft: Java Edition** introduced functions! Now is **Marshal Command Code**'s time to shine! Of course, we haven't forgotten about our friends over at [Smelt](http://smelt.gnasp.com). That's why we've decided to provide explicit support for Smelt through .mcc and MC Functions through .mcfunction files!

__What is Marshal Command Code?__

Marshal Command Code is a syntax highlighter built for Sublime Text! Our goal is to provide practical highlighting to support as many themes as possible. We attempt to strike a balance between categorization and readability, meaning the code highlights the relevant parts of the logic while checking for errors in the rigid structure of NBT, JSON, the scoreboard, and commands themselves.

__Well, what does it look like?__

## Installation

Support has come for VSCode! Simply search for "Marhsal Command Code" from the Extensions icon!

Now any file with an .mcc extension will use the Minecraft Command Code syntax highlighting.

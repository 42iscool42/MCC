## Using MCC Will Make Your Code Maintainable

__ Latest news__

The v1.12 update of **Minecraft: Java Edition** introduced functions! Now is **Mine Command Code**'s time to shine! Of course, we haven't forgotten about our friends over at [Smelt](http://smelt.gnasp.com). That's why we've decided to provide explicit support for both .mcc and .mcfunction files!

__What is Minecraft Command Code?__

Minecraft Command Code is a syntax highlighter built for Sublime Text! Our goal is to provide practical highlighting to support as many themes as possible. We attempt to strike a balance between categorization and readability, meaning the code highlights the relevant parts of the logic while checking for errors in the rigid structure of NBT, JSON, the scoreboard, and commands themselves.

__Well, what does it look like?__

## Installation

Sublime is an extremely powerful, but kind of complicated, text editor. Learning how to use it effectively will be key to keeping your code maintainable.

### Instructions

*Installing Package Control can be scary, but just follow the instructions carefuly. You'll be OK.*

1. Install [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2. Install [Package Control Plugin](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) (double-check your Sublime version)
3. With Sublime opened, press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette
4. Type "install package" into the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package"
5. Type "MinecraftCommandCode" to filter the packages and select "Minecraft Command Code Syntax Highlighter"

Now any file with an .mcc extension will use the Minecraft Command Code syntax highlighting.

## Using MCC Will Help Make Your Code Maintainable

Minecraft Map Making is more complex than ever.

Besides learning how commands, scoreboards, and entities interfact with each other, we also have to keep a mental network of what command is in each block. MCC aims to aid mechanics (formerly known as command blockers) in writing maintainable code through adding support for syntax highlighting.

Minecraft Commands are constantly envolving. By writing your commands into a text document rather than Command Blocks, you're able have a good overview of what needs to be changed. We've made it even more enticing by adding syntax highlighting to all Minecraft's commands *which can be put into a Command Block*.

Minecraft Command Code is plays nice with [Smelt](http://smelt.gnasp.com) Code Compiler by Gnasp, which means you can make and deploy changes quickly.

## Installation

Sublime is an extremely powerful, but kind of complicated, text editor. Learning how to use it effectively will be key to keeping your code maintainable.

### Instructions

*Installing Package Control can be scary, but just follow the instructions carefuly. You'll be OK.*

1. Install [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2. Install [Package Control Plugin](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) (double-check your Sublime version)
3. With Sublime opened, press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette
4. Type "install package" into the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package"
5. Type "MinecraftCommandCode" to filter the packages and select "Minecraft Command Code Syntax Highlighter"

Now any file with a .mcc extension will use the Minecraft Command Code syntax highlighting.
